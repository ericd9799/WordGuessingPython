# Word Guessing Game
Continuing my practice of developing in Python. This time I looked into using the pandas library to read data from a file. 

As the title says, this is a word guessing game. The number of characters in the word equates to the number of guesses you have at trying to figure out the word. If you guess the same letter more than once, it will not count against your tries. The words used for guessing will be read in from a file.
